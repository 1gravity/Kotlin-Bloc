- TODO make the StateMachine thread safe (again)
- TODO have separate Dispatchers for initialize, reducers, side effects and thunks in a Bloc
- TODO think about the initial value, who/what provides it? should be have a mechanism to populate
       the BlocState upon start? especially ReduxBlocState has TWO initial values (one for the
       ReduxStore and one in the BlocState)
       how about using the redux mechanism using an ActionTypes.INIT to initialize state?
- TODO are side effects sufficient for navigation? should the framework include a navigation
       component like Decompose does?
- TODO Action / Redux style vs. Function style (extensions to BlocOwner), the latter requires some
       component / class like the PostsComponent / PostsComponentImpl class so we can use functions
       in iOS too. Come up with a solution that combines both styles for Android and iOS without
       the need for a "container" component.
- TODO implement tests
- TODO time machine
