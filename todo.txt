- TODO implement tests + add to CI/CD
- TODO create an FAQ
- TODO think about the initial value, who/what provides it? should be have a mechanism to populate
       the BlocState upon start? especially ReduxBlocState has TWO initial values (one for the
       ReduxStore and one in the BlocState)
       how about using the redux mechanism using an ActionTypes.INIT to initialize state?
- TODO are side effects sufficient for navigation? should the framework include a navigation
       component like Decompose does? we can also just use reducers instead of side effects.
- TODO Action / Redux style vs. Function style (extensions to BlocOwner), the latter requires some
       component / class like the PostsComponent / PostsComponentImpl class so we can use functions
       in iOS too. Come up with a solution that combines both styles for Android and iOS without
       the need for a "container" component.
- TODO time travel + debugger
- TODO implement `sideEffects` in the Bloc DSL to allow emission of multiple side effects
       (`sideEffect` allows only a single side effect)
- TODO compiler plugin to have compile-time checks when building Blocs and BlocStates
- TODO synchronize initializers / onCreate execution with the lifecycle of the bloc
       -> a bloc could not transition to Started while the initializer is still running
       we would only need to synchronize the initializer code block itself and not wait for
       dispatched actions to be processed because those actions won't be executed before the bloc is
       started / transitions to Started
